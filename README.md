# deploy_button

Need push-button deployments? Here's how to wire up the button!

This project uses an Adafruit Trinket to wire up a "deploy" button to a desktop over a USB serial connection.

When the button is pressed, arbitrary commands can be executed on the desktop corresponding to a blinking yellow LED followed by a solid green LED.

Fritzing layout included, and the desktop client is provided for both a Python command line or a desktop UI.
